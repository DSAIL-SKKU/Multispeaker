        Args:
            cell: An instance of `RNNCell`.
            attention_mechanism: A list of `AttentionMechanism` instances or a single
                instance.
            attention_layer_size: A list of Python integers or a single Python
                integer, the depth of the attention (output) layer(s). If None
                (default), use the context as attention at each time step. Otherwise,
                feed the context and cell output into the attention layer to generate
                attention at each time step. If attention_mechanism is a list,
                attention_layer_size must be a list of the same length.
            alignment_history: Python boolean, whether to store alignment history
                from all time steps in the final output state (currently stored as a
                time major `TensorArray` on which you must call `stack()`).
            cell_input_fn: (optional) A `callable`.    The default is:
                `lambda inputs, attention: array_tf.concat([inputs, attention], -1)`.
            output_attention: Python bool.    If `True` (default), the output at each
                time step is the attention value.    This is the behavior of Luong-style
                attention mechanisms.    If `False`, the output at each time step is
                the output of `cell`.    This is the beahvior of Bhadanau-style
                attention mechanisms.    In both cases, the `attention` tensor is
                propagated to the next time step via the state and is used there.
                This flag only controls whether the attention mechanism is propagated
                up to the next cell in an RNN stack or to the top RNN output.
            initial_cell_state: The initial state value to use for the cell when
                the user calls `zero_state()`.    Note that if this value is provided
                now, and the user uses a `batch_size` argument of `zero_state` which
                does not match the batch size of `initial_cell_state`, proper
                behavior is not guaranteed.

  attention_layer_size=None and output_attention=False. Such a cell's state will include an
  "attention" field that is the context vector.
